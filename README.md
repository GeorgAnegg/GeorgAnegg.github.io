# I am passionate about...

## Software Engineering

I have built bespoke software applications from scratch to production in various data-centric domains, including scientific computing, operations research, and automation. 

Tools I have used include:
- Python (numpy, pandas, scikit-learn, flask, conda, pytest, mypy, pylint), Scala, Matlab, VBA
- Docker, Jenkins, SonarQube, GitLab CI/CD
- git, Linux, bash

## Education

I find learning and teaching to be among the most satisfying activities. 

From a young age, my natural desire to understand deeply led me to mathematics and my tendency to optimize the learning process to teaching.

My academic journey has led me from mathematics to computer science to software to business administration.
As a layperson, I enjoy learning about topics like
Linguistics and Languages,
Poetry,
Creativity and Humor,
Neuroscience,
Philosophy of Science,
Self-Discovery and Self-Knowledge,
Board Game and Puzzle Strategy,
Geopolitics.

My teaching-related endeavors include the following.  

2018-2023:  
As a teaching assistant during my doctoral studies, I have given lectures, developed teaching and assessment materials, recruited and guided teaching assistants, and supervised eight student research projects.
I also continued my own learning with courses on
Interactive Teaching, 
Intercultural Teaching, and
Educational Psychology.

Because of my passion for educational equity, I contributed to academic outreach and partnership efforts including [this networking event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/962934/) I co-organized and [this teaching endeavour](https://eth4d.ethz.ch/Learning/AshesiETH-Master.html) in Ghana, which you can read about [here](https://math.ethz.ch/news-and-events/news/d-math-news/2022/07/teaching-mathematics-in-africa.html).

2016-2018:  
I was the Head Tutor at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://aims.ac.za/) in Cape Town, South Africa. 
As Head Tutor, I was responsible for all teaching-related activities in a graduate mathematics degree program. I led the team of eight graduate teaching assistans and also contributed to the teaching and mentoring myself.
You can read about it [here](https://ethambassadors.ethz.ch/2019/10/17/the-future-is-african-a-unique-teaching-experience-in-south-africa/).

2012-2014:  
After competing in mathematics competitions ([Bronze Medal IMO 2011](https://www.imo-official.org/participant_r.aspx?id=21073), [Second Price IMC 2012](https://www.imc-math.org.uk/?year=2012&item=results)), I got involved in teaching efforts in this area, i.e. competition preparation.
I have also supervised competitions and have authored a number of original problems that have appeared in national competitions in Austria, see e.g. [here](https://www.math.aau.at/OeMO/problems/ZWF/2015).

## Research

I am interested in both theoretical and applied research in the fields of 
Operations Research (Modelling, Mathematical Programming) and 
Optimization Algorithms (Combinatorial Optimization, Approximation Algorithms).

You can find my published work on 
[GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=sr4ehiYAAAAJ&hl=en) and
[dblp](https://dblp.org/pid/262/8265.html).  

### Applied Research

At the Institute for Operations Research at ETH, I have worked with industry and public sector partners as a Business Analytics and Operations Research consultant. 
These include Helvetiv Motion, the Federal Office of Public Health Switzerland, and the Academic Services of ETH Zurich.
Typically, the goal of these projects was applying methods from Operations Research to their business problems, from assessing feasibility to prototyping and productive usage.
Additionally, I have conducted research on fundamental algorithmic questions in computer architecture at Huawei's Zurich Research Center. 

### Theoretical Research

My doctoral research revolved around designing approximation algorithms for various Combinatorial Optimization problems, in particular fair clustering problems. 
Together with collaborators, I made progress on open problems by developing new algorithmic techniques that lead to stronger algorithms for particular classes of problems.

My doctoral advisor was Prof. Dr. Rico Zenklusen and my co-examiner was Prof. Dr. Ola Svensson. I [passed my doctoral exam](https://math.ethz.ch/news-and-events/news/d-math-news/2023/07/doctoral-exam-of-georg-anegg.html) on 05.07.2023.
