## Get in touch

LinkedIn, Research homepage

I am a full-time MBA fellow at CDI and Infineon Technologies (expected graduation July 2024).

I did my PhD (in Mathematics/Theoretical Computer Science) in the group of Rico Zenklusen at the Institute for Operations Research at ETH ZÃ¼rich. 

## Technology

Research on algorithms and computer architecture.
Software Development using various technologies.

## Education

## Research

### Theoretical Research

My main research interest is designing approximation algorithms for various Combinatorial Optimization problems, in particular fair clustering problems. You can find my publications on Google Scholar and dblp.

### Applied Research

I also enjoy applying techniques from optimization and operations research to real-world problems: I have built and deployed bespoke software solutions for solving real-world optimization problems of various industry parners, including Helvetiv Motion, the Federal Office of Public Health Switzerland, and the Academic Services of ETH Zurich.

In 2022, I spent nine-months at Huawei's Zurich Research Center in the Computing Systems Lab, researching possibilities and limits of parallel programming models.

## CV (in prose)

Before starting my PhD, I was the Head Tutor at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences in Cape Town, South Africa, for two years. I continue to be involved with academic outreach and partnership efforts in Africa including this networking event I co-organized and this teaching endeavour in Ghana.

Before that, I graduated with an MMath and BA from the University of Cambridge in 2016.

Before that, I competed in mathematics competitions and got a Bronze Medal at the IMO 2011 and a Second Prize at the IMC 2012. I have also contributed a number of original problems that have appeared in competitions.
