# About me

I am currently a full-time MBA fellow at [CDI](https://cdi.eu) (expected graduation July 2024).

## Short CV

I did my PhD (in Mathematics/Theoretical Computer Science) in the group of Rico Zenklusen at the Institute for Operations Research at ETH ZÃ¼rich.

# I am passionate about...

## Software Engineering

I have built custom software (from scratch to production) for various data-centric applications.

Tools I have used include:
Python (numpy, pandas, flask, conda, pytest, mypy, pylint)  
Scala  
Matlab

Docker
GitLab CI

## Education

I find learning and teaching to be among the most satisfying activities.

Here are some of my teaching activities
2018-2023:
During my doctoral studies, I have given lectures, developed teaching and assessment materials, and have supervised student research projects.
At ETH, I have also taken courses on  
Inclusive Teaching, 
Educational Psychology, and 
Intercultural Communication.

2016-2018:
I was the Head Tutor at the [African Institute for Mathematical Sciences](https://aims.ac.za/) in Cape Town, South Africa, for two years. 

I was involved with other academic outreach and partnership efforts in Africa including [this networking event](https://indico.cern.ch/event/962934/) I co-organized and [this teaching endeavour](https://eth4d.ethz.ch/Learning/AshesiETH-Master.html) in Ghana.

2012-2014:
I used to compete in mathematics competitions (Bronze Medal IMO 2011, Second Price IMC 2012) and have also been involved in teaching efforts in this area.
I have contributed a number of original problems that have appeared in national competitions in Austria.

## Research

I am interested in both theoretical and applied research in the field of optimization algorithms.

### Applied Research

I have worked with a number of industry partners who are interested in applying Operations Research.

I also enjoy applying techniques from optimization and operations research to real-world problems: I have built and deployed bespoke software solutions for solving real-world optimization problems of various industry parners, including Helvetiv Motion, the Federal Office of Public Health Switzerland, and the Academic Services of ETH Zurich.

In 2022, I spent nine-months at Huawei's Zurich Research Center in the Computing Systems Lab, researching possibilities and limits of parallel programming models.

### Theoretical Research

My main research interest is designing approximation algorithms for various Combinatorial Optimization problems, in particular fair clustering problems. You can find my publications on Google Scholar and dblp.
